# Framework Level (Laravel) Security Best Practices
- Single responsibility principle
- Fat models, skinny controllers
- Validation - Move validation from controllers to Request classes
- Business logic should be in service class
- Donâ€™t repeat yourself (DRY)
- Prefer to use Eloquent over using Query Builder and raw SQL queries. Prefer collections over arrays
- Mass assignment
- Do not execute queries in Blade templates and use eager loading (N + 1 problem)
- Comment your code, but prefer descriptive method and variable names over comments
- Do not put JS and CSS in Blade templates and do not put any HTML in PHP classes
- Use config and language files, constants instead of text in the code
- Use standard Laravel tools accepted by community
- Follow Laravel naming conventions - Follow PSR standards
- Use shorter and more readable syntax where possible
- Use IoC container or facades instead of new Class
- Do not get data from the .env file directly
- Store dates in the standard format. Use accessors and mutators to modify date format
